    "In the following, we will demonstrate an example of protein structure prediction utilizing sequences we generate from an AI model. In this case we'll be using ProtGPT2, a language model that generates protein sequences that are similar to their natural counterparts.  But before we generate our own sequences, let's take a look at the BioNeMo UniProt lookup service. This can be leveraged to retrieve the sequence of a protein-of-interest, using the UniProt ID as input. Here we will be looking at [Thioredoxin](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P10599/entry). This small protein plays a vital role in regulating cellular redox (reduction–oxidation) homeostasis by reducing disulfide bonds in proteins. It is found in most living organisms, from bacteria to humans. It acts as a reducing agent by donating electrons to other proteins to help maintain their proper shape and function. It also helps to remove reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells, which can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids if not removed.\n",

Let's suppose that there are 43 valid, whole protein sequences from the generative iteration. Of these 43 whole protein sequences, only the top `percent_to_keep`, according to perplexity, are kept. For instance, with percent_to_keep=10, only ~4 of the 43 sequences (i.e., ~10% of 43) will be kept. After these 4 sequences are added to the return object, the generation process will resume until `num_return_sequences` is reached.
