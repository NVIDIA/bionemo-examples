    "This example notebook shows how to connect BioNeMo service models to conduct a virtual drug screening workflow. We'll infuse our workflow with AI at every step, from ligand generation to protein folding to docking. All of these capabilities are enabled by NVIDIA's BioNeMo framework for Large Language Model training and inference.

    "#### Protein Structure Prediction\n",
    "Protein structure prediction refers to predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein based on its amino acid sequence. This is important because a protein’s function is often determined by its structure, and accurate structure prediction can aid in drug discovery. Protein structure prediction models (such as AlphaFold2, ESMFold and OpenFold) are typically trained using deep learning techniques on large datasets of known protein structures. These models have many uses, including drug discovery, understanding disease mechanisms, and designing new proteins with specific functions. A high-quality protein structure provides researchers with an authentic biological target for drug design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Small Molecule Generation\n",
    "Small molecule generation is the process of using deep learning models to generate novel chemical structures. These models are typically trained on large databases of existing molecules and learn to generate new molecules that have similar properties to those in the training set. Small molecule generation models, such as MegaMolBART and MoFlow can be used for a variety of applications, including drug discovery, that involve in silico design of novel molecules. They allow for the generation of novel compounds and can aid in the discovery of new drug candidates with improved efficacy, safety, and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Molecular Docking\n",
    "Molecular docking is a computational method used to predict the binding affinity and structure of a small molecule ligand binding to a protein target. This information allows for the identification of potential drug candidates that can selectively bind to a target protein and modulate its function. Classical molecular docking methods are often based on simulations or heuristics such as complementary shapes. However, these can be either computationally expensive, or rely on approximations and simplifications that can limit their accuracy. Machine learning models such as DiffDock offer new solutions for molecular docking by leveraging existing data to provide more accurate and efficient methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions. DiffDock learns the complex structural patterns of known ligand-bound proteins (holo structures), uses this learning to predict multiple binding poses for a given ligand-protein pair and ranks the poses in order of prediction confidence.\n",

    "Now that we've clarified the major steps of the drug discovery process, let's get started with a hands-on example. \n",

    "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a critical enzyme involved in the folate metabolic pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and other essential cellular components. DHFR catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is required for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and other molecules necessary for DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation.\n",
    "\n",
    "DHFR inhibitors have been used as anticancer and antibacterial agents due to their ability to disrupt the folate metabolic pathway and inhibit DNA synthesis. Methotrexate, a potent inhibitor of DHFR, has been used to treat several types of cancer, including leukemia and lymphoma. Trimethoprim, another DHFR inhibitor, has been used as an antibacterial agent to treat bacterial infections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take a virtual drug screening approach used to identify potential drug candidates that can bind to a the DHFR protein found in Humans. In this approach, we will use AI generative models to construct a library of small molecules that are similar in structure to known DHFR inhibitors.  After obtaining a DHFR protein sequence and folding it with an AI model - we'll use a diffusion generative model to predict docked binding poses. In a production workflow, this data would be used to predict candidates with the strongest binding affinities to DHFR. The most promising targets would be synthesized experimentally to confirm their activity and selectivity towards the target protein.\n",

    "At this point the pose confidence can be used to advise further study. For a high-confidence result, consider sending a service request with a higher number of pose generations. Or use the corresponding ligand SMILES string as a seed for MoFlow or MegaMolBART, iterating on your results to find a stronger target. \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we've covered a virtual drug screening pipeline using BioNeMo services for each step:\n",
    " - Protein structure generation\n",
    " - Small molecule generation\n",
    " - Molecular Docking\n",
    " \n",
    "Leveraging BioNeMo's capabilities for predicting protein structure and generating a set of target molecules, we are able to use docking models to predict multiple binding poses for each given ligand-protein pair and rank the poses in order of prediction confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this notebook as a starting guide for your own AI-accelerated virtual drug screening journey with BioNeMo. Now with NVIDIA cloud APIs, researchers can quickly customize and deploy domain-specific, state-of-the-art generative and predictive biomolecular AI models at scale. With these generative AI models, BioNeMo enables researchers to rapidly generate the structure and function of proteins and biomolecules, accelerating the creation of new drug candidates. We can't wait to see what you accomplish!"
